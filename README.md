# Chores And Shop App

## This Project Made During "Integrative Software Development" Course.

## Project Explenation:
  We were asked to create miniApps that will be the client side for the server we built.
  This repository contains an Android application designed to manage chores and a reward system for 
  a family. The app includes features such as tracking chores, purchasing prizes, and viewing family 
  member information.

### The Features:
  * User Authentication: Sign up and login functionality using Retrofit and a REST API.
  * Chore Management: Users can view and mark chores as done. Parents have the ability to create new     chores.
  * Reward System: Children can purchase prizes using points earned from completing chores.
  * Family Member Management: Displays a list of family members, sorted by role and points.
  * Pagination Support: Efficiently loads data with pagination to handle large lists of chores and       prizes.
  * User Role Handling: Different views and actions based on whether the user is a parent or a child.
  * Dashboard: Displays a list of items (prizes) with pagination support.
  * Item Management: Users can add new items (chores or prizes).
  * Purchase Functionality: Users can purchase items from the dashboard.
 
### Technologies Used:
  * Java: Main programming language used for development.
  * Retrofit: For making network requests.
  * Material Components: For UI elements.
  * RecyclerView: For displaying lists of items.
  * Pagination: To handle large datasets efficiently.
  * Android SDK: Core development framework.
